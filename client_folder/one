this is bd proj
an attempt to read a 
file
which has a massive 
amt of data
and needs to be 
divided into
partitions 
and those partitions are to be 
kept on
different
nodes.
after doing all that
we'll be all set to
put those
partitions wali files
into different 
nodes
and
afterwards, 
those nodes will help us to 
combine all the info in
them by merging them 
again we get another
file
then finally map reduce
looks complex
but will try my level 
best no matter what happens!!
